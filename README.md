# Code-Reviewer

The Code-Reviewer project provides a streamlined system for automatically reviewing code changes, offering feedback and suggestions to developers.  
It links a frontend interface to a backend engine that analyses code, tracks comments, and helps maintain code-quality.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🗨️ 1. Developer Submission  
- A developer opens the frontend interface and submits a code change (for example, a pull request or diff).  
- The change is sent to the backend along with context such as file names, diff lines, and metadata (author, branch, etc).

### ⚙️ 2. Backend Processing  
- The backend receives the submission and parses the code changes (diffs).  
- It may extract relevant files, identify added/modified lines, and gather context (existing codebase, style guidelines).  
- The backend then runs the analysis engine:  
  - It applies static analysis rules and best-practice checks.  
  - It may call a language model or rule engine to generate comments/suggestions.  
  - It builds a set of review feedback items (e.g., improvements, style fixes, bug risks).

### 🤖 3. Feedback Generation  
- The review engine returns structured feedback items (for example: file — line — comment).  
- The backend formats these into a payload that the frontend can render.  

### 💬 4. Frontend Display & Interaction  
- The frontend receives the formatted feedback and displays it alongside the code change.  
- Developers can view comments inline, accept/reject suggestions, and iterate.  
- The system can also allow for discussion threads, marking feedback as resolved, etc.

### 🧩 5. Optional Features  
Depending on your implementation, Code-Reviewer may also:  
- Store review history in a database (for tracking trends, metrics)  
- Maintain code-quality dashboards (e.g., number of issues, resolution time)  
- Support custom configuration (style guidelines, rule sets, model parameters)  
- Integrate with version-control or CI/CD pipelines for automatic review triggers

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

| Component     | Role |
|--------------|------|
| **Frontend**  | Interface for submitting code changes, viewing comments, interacting with review feedback |
| **Backend**   | Receives code change data, triggers analysis, formats and sends feedback |
| **Review Engine** | Core logic that analyses code (via static rules, ML/AI or heuristics) and generates suggestions |

## 💡 Core Idea

Code-Reviewer acts as a **bridge** between your codebase and high-quality feedback —  
automating reviews so you can focus on development, not manual feedback loops.

### 🧾 Example Summary

1. Developer submits a diff.  
2. Backend sends it to the review engine.  
3. Review engine generates comments.  
4. Frontend displays comments inline.  
5. Developer iterates or fixes accordingly.

That’s Code-Reviewer — efficient, consistent, and geared for code quality. 🚀
